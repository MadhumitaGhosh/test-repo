It’s okay to treat a “Likert Scale” as continuous as an independent (explanatory/predictor) variable in a regression model or a logistic 
regression model.

1. There is a difference between a “Likert Scale” item (a single 1-5 scale, eg.) and a full Likert Scale , which is composed of multiple items.
If it is a full Likert Scale, with a combination of multiple items, go ahead and treat it as numerical.

2. If it is a single item, it is probably fine to treat it as numerical.  There is more justification for this if it has 7 or more values, but 
even with 5 you may be okay.

3. There are no assumptions about the distribution of the predictor variables in any regression.  However, parameter estimates generally are only
interpretable for nominal categories or numerical quantities.
The coefficient is interpreted as the difference in the mean of Y, the outcome, for each one-unit difference in X, the predictor.  If the 
predictor is categorical and dummy coded, a one-unit difference simply refers to switching from one category to the other.  If the predictor is 
numerical, a one-unit difference should be meaningful.
Ordinal predictor variables have to be treated as either nominal unordered categories or numerical.  In the former case, you are throwing away 
information about the ordering.  In the latter, you’re making assumptions about the differences between the scale items.  If those distances can 
be reasonably considered equal and meaningful, then it is reasonable to treat the predictor as numerical (i.e., if a one-unit change from 1 to 2 
is roughly equivalent to a one-unit change from 3 to 4).
